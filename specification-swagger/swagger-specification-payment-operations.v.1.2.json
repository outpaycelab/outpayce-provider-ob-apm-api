    "description": "**Preliminary Note:** This document aims at describing how to use the Amadeus JSON API for core Payment  *Operation* management, dealing with payment transactions. \nIt is tailored for card only operations. This is an early alpha  version of the API that therefore is prone to change and has no contract value. \nAmadeus APIs comply with Amadeus REST/JSON Rules  & Guideline v1.3 and are based on *application/vnd.amadeus+json* [media type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For further details please refer to [developers.amadeus.com](https://developers.amadeus.com).\n ## Authentication\n ### *Basic HTTP Authentication method*:\n With this method, one of the request headers (Authorization request header) is populated with a username/password pair, encoded using Base64. \n ```\nContent-Type: \"application/vnd.amadeus+json\" \n Authorization: \"Basic VXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=\" \n ``` \n\n## Resource: *Operations*\nThe main payment resource used here is the '*Operations*' resource. An *Operation* is either a payment operation implying or not a direct move of funds between a payer and a payee. An *Operation* is therefore an abstract resource  that may be one of the following: *Authorization*, *Reversal*, *Capture* and *Refund*.\n\n### Payment Operation ontology\n\n#### *Authorization*\nAn  *Authorization* is usually the first transaction performed during the acceptance stage of a payment, ie an agreement on some money to be exchanged, at once or later, between two parties, the individual or corporate *payer* and the *payee*. When successful, it usually results in the amount at  stake being blocked for a limited period of time on the payer's account.\n\n#### *Reversal*\nA *Reversal* is an optional transaction which  must be consecutive to a successful authorization performed during the acceptance stage of a payment. It consists in partially or fully reversing the previously authorized amount.\n\n#### *Capture* & *Refund*\n*Capture* and *Refund* are operations performed during the clearing stage of a payment, ie when service is sold and money has to be transferred, and vice versa. Depending on the payment, *Capture* could be immediate at *Authorization* time  when successful. This is what is called 1-step or single-message payment. In that case, the *Authorization* prevails and there is no use of any separate  *Capture*. Otherwise, money actually starts to move only when the act of *Capture* is confirmed, which is called 2-step or dual-message payment choreography.  When reimbursement is due, a *Refund* will be issued from the *payee* to the *payer*.\n\n## Quickstart Guide\n\n### 1. Merchant account setup\nAmadeus Payment Gateway sends payment operations on behalf of merchants. A merchant is identified in your system by a *MERCHANT_ACCOUNT*.\n\n### 2. Authorization\nAt the end of a fruitful shopping session, the client of the merchant agrees to pay with their payment card _4000000000000001_ for an amount of _123.45€_. Amadeus Payment Gateway collects the card information and sends a request to your system such as:\n```\nPUT https://{your-host-name}/outpayce/v1/authorizations/{authorizationId} HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.amadeus+json\n...\n  \n{\n  \"data\": {\n      \"id\": \"{authorizationId}\",\n      \"amount\": {\n          \"value\": \"123.45\",\n          \"currencyCode\": \"EUR\"\n      },\n      \"authorizationType\": \"AUTHORIZATION_ONLY\",\n      \"method\": \"CARD\",\n      \"card\": {\n          \"vendorCode\": \"VI\",\n          \"cardNumber\": \"4000000000000001\",\n          \"cvv\": \"123\",\n          \"expiryDate\": \"2024-12\"\n      },\n      \"operationContext\": {\n          \"merchantAccount\": {\n              \"name\": \"MERCHANT_ACCOUNT\",\n              \"login\": \"merchantLogin\",\n              \"password\": {\n                 \"payload\":\"merchantPasword\"\n              }\n          }\n     }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYour application parses the request and after processing it, returns a response such as:\n  ```\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nLocation: https://{your-host-name}/outpayce/v1/authorizations/{authorizationId}\nContent-Type: application/vnd.amadeus+json\n\n  {\n    \"data\": {\n        \"id\": \"{authorizationId}\",\n        \"method\": \"CARD\",\n        \"card\": {\n            \"vendorCode\": \"VI\",\n            \"maskedCardNumber\": \"400000------0001\"\n        },\n        \"approvalCode\": \"APPROVAL_CODE\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2022-11-28T13:37:00Z\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n*With regards to Credit Card transactions, this is the minimum amount of data Outpayce expects to receive in the response. Without at least these fields, Outpayce will not be able to process the Authorization response.There are other optional fields that can be sent in the response such as **externalId** and **schemeTransactionId**.*\n \n Usually, after this successful operation, the order is confirmed and the checkout process ends here.\n\n### 3.

        "description": "This endpoint initiates an authorization operation.\n\n# Examples of scenarios\n## Basic Card Authorization\nThis is basic authorization scenario where card information is provided to perform a successful authorization. This data is the minimum amount of data Outpayce will always send as part of an authorization request.\n\n## Authorization with additional data\nThis is an authorization request that includes details related to the merchant account or acquirer information. If these details are provided, they will always be included in the payload of the request.\n\n## Authorization with 3DSv2 Data\nThis is an authorization request populated with 3DSv2 authentication details.\n\n## Authorization with Travel Segment data\nThis is an authorization request populated with flight and pasenger details.\n\n## Authorization with Installment data \nThis is an authorization request populated with  Installment data.\n\n## Authorization request with Card on File Capabilities\n### Initial Storing request of CC details\nThis is an authorization scenario where the cardholder initiates the transaction. On top of setting the _transactionInitiator_ as 'HOLDER', the API consumer also indicates the _instrumentFilingRequest_ of 'STORING'.\n\n### Cardholder Initiated Transaction with Card on File\nThis is an authorization scenario where the cardholder initiates the transaction using stored credentials. On top of setting the _transactionInitiator_ as 'HOLDER', the API consumer also indicates the _instrumentFilingRequest_ of 'REUSE'.\n\n### Merchant Initiated Transaction\nThis is an authorization scenario where the merchant initiates the transaction, on behalf of the cardholder. In that case, on top of setting the _transactionInitiator_ as 'MERCHANT', this time the API consumer also indicates the _instrumentFilingRequest_ of 'REUSE'.\n\n### Request Examples\n### Basic Card Authorization Request\n```\n  PUT https://{your-host-name}/outpayce/v1/authorizations/{authorizationId} HTTP/1.1\n  Content-Type: application/vnd.amadeus+json\n  ...\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": \"{authorizationId}\",\n    \"amount\": {\n      \"value\": \"123.45\",\n      \"currencyCode\": \"EUR\"\n    },\n    \"authorizationType\": \"AUTHORIZATION_ONLY\",\n    \"method\": \"CARD\",\n    \"card\": {\n      \"vendorCode\": \"VI\",\n      \"cardNumber\": \"4000000000000001\",\n      \"cvv\": \"123\",\n      \"expiryDate\": \"2024-12\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Authorization with additional data\n```\n  PUT https://{your-host-name}/outpayce/v1/authorizations/{authorizationId} HTTP/1.1\n  Content-Type: application/vnd.amadeus+json\n  ...\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": \"{authorizationId}\",\n    \"amount\": {\n      \"value\": \"123.45\",\n      \"currencyCode\": \"EUR\"\n    },\n    \"authorizationType\": \"AUTHORIZATION_ONLY\",\n    \"method\": \"CARD\",\n    \"pointOfInteraction\": {\n      \"operatingEnvironment\": {\n        \"holderInteractionMode\": \"ECOMMERCE\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"card\": {\n      \"vendorCode\": \"VI\",\n      \"cardNumber\": \"4000000000000001\",\n      \"cvv\": \"123\",\n      \"holderName\": \"Card Holder Name\",\n      \"expiryDate\": \"2024-12\"\n    },\n    \"operationContext\": {\n      \"merchantAccount\": {\n        \"name\": \"MERCHANT_ACCOUNT\",\n        \"login\": \"merchantLogin\",\n        \"password\": {\n          \"payload\": \"merchantPasword\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"acquirerInformation\": {\n        \"acquirerBin\": \"ACQUIRER_BIN\",\n        \"acquirerCountry\": \"acquirerCountry\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n### Authorization with 3DSv2 data\n```\n  PUT https://{your-host-name}/outpayce/v1/authorizations/{authorizationId} HTTP/1.1\n  Content-Type: application/vnd.amadeus+json\n  ...\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": \"{authorizationId}\",\n    \"amount\": {\n      \"value\": \"123.45\",\n      \"currencyCode\": \"EUR\"\n    },\n    \"authorizationType\": \"AUTHORIZATION_ONLY\",\n    \"method\": \"CARD\",\n    \"card\": {\n      \"vendorCode\": \"VI\",\n      \"cardNumber\": \"4000000000000001\",\n      \"cvv\": \"123\",\n      \"holderName\": \"Card Holder Name\",\n      \"expiryDate\": \"2024-12\"\n    },\n    \"operationContext\": {\n      \"merchantAccount\": {\n        \"name\": \"MERCHANT_ACCOUNT\",\n        \"login\": \"merchantLogin\",\n        \"password\": {\n          \"payload\": \"merchantPasword\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"acquirerInformation\": {\n        \"acquirerBin\": \"ACQUIRER_BIN\",\n        \"acquirerCountry\": \"acquirerCountry\"\n      },\n      \"threeDomainSecure\": {\n        \"eci\": \"05\",\n        \"cavv\": \"AJkBAWUDOQAAABu8l4F5dQAAAAB=\",\n        \"transStatus\": \"Y\",\n        \"version\": \"2.2.0\",\n        \"dsTransactionId\": \"e9bed923-7dbe-4e03-9886-1c4c3bba4934\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Authorization with Travel Segment Data\n```\n  PUT https://{your-host-name}/outpayce/v1/authorizations/{authorizationId} HTTP/1.1\n  Content-
